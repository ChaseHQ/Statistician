Commonly asked questions:

[Q] What are the table names?
[A] blocks, config, creatures,kill_types, kills, pickup_drop, players, projectiles, resource_desc, server

[Q]I am getting this error "[SEVERE] Error occurred while enabling Statistician v1.3 (Is it up to date?): java.lang.Integer cannot be cast to java.lang.String"
[A] This is most likely down to your DBConfig.yml being incorrect, there are a few checks you can do. This is how it should look:

database_name: 'name'
database_address: address
database_username: 'username'
database_password: 'password'
database_port: 3306
database_update_time: 120

Port and Update time should never have quotes around them as they are ALWAYS numbers. You don't always need quotes around your name and password but if they are made of just number you MUST put them in quotes.
